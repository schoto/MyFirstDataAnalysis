# MyFirstDataAnalysis
I decided to do my first data analysis on Elon Musk's Twitter profile (likes,reposts,views,retweets, etc) I won't be using complex tools or languages. It's just a start for me, so be kind, please üôè 


All the steps I did and every achivement of this process will be displayed here in this doc

Let's begin?

APIFY PART

First I went to Elon's Twitter account to copy the link (I need it to scrape the data from there)

Now I go to Apify which is a web scraper. You don't actually need to download any kind of software : all on website.


#######I know I could use Python for this task, but as I said earlier , I won't be using complex tools or languages######

Apify is not the only option you have if you want to do some web scraping. You may consider another option, I know this one is fast and does everything I need for this task.

Here's the Apify interface. Tasks are called ACTORS and you have a lot of pre-configured ACTORS, like Linkedin and others.

If you click on task, you can see it's parameters

![Firefox_Screenshot_2023-02-17T14-23-21 459Z](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69323411/219680912-a8e4229b-a892-48fc-842c-37709091ba02.png)

You have several tabs 


![Firefox_Screenshot_2023-02-17T14-30-53 846Z](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69323411/219682993-8df4ef19-197d-40da-a43e-6005cdf75f5b.png)

And of course you can export all of data you scraped. I will download the CSV format, because I'll upload it later to Google Sheets for cleaning

![Firefox_Screenshot_2023-02-17T14-32-00 882Z](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69323411/219683434-9c332387-e02d-4505-8ada-efa3b6c0a149.png)

When you open the downloaded CSV file, it's a total mess. There are a lot of columns we don't need, a lot of information we won't analyze.

GOOGLE SHEETS PART

Why not clean it and delete all unecessary columns?

![Firefox_Screenshot_2023-02-17T15-32-02 058Z(1)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69323411/219697476-3c909bcd-a69d-41c8-ba8a-31eaec901bbb.png)

I think it looks better ü§åüèª

We did all the cleaning stuff

Now it's time to start our analysis work

FYI I pulled more than 1000 rows from Twitter with Apify, but now I have only 246 rows-tweets.
Why?
Because there were rows with NULL values or with 0 values. We don't need them. So we will work with these 246 rows.

Let's imagine that I have a very kind boss who asks me to perform some basic calculations on these rows.


‚ùìHe wants to know how many people added Elon's LAST 246 tweets to FAVORITES ‚ùì

‚ùìHow many views he had over these tweets ‚ùì

‚ùìHow many times he mentioned someone in his tweets ‚ùì

‚ùìHow many tweets there are with a media file with a photo or image‚ùì

For the first 2 questions we can use the SUM function in Sheets that will do the addition of all values in selected column.

ANSWER TO QUESTION 1 --> ‚ùìHe wants to know how many people added Elon's LAST 246 tweets to FAVORITES ‚ùì

The result

![Firefox_Screenshot_2023-02-17T18-05-21 178Z](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69323411/219742338-7f89db64-2745-4aec-a562-753de5fabfa3.png)


But it's kinda hard to read this number. We will format it to "number". You'll see the difference


![Firefox_Screenshot_2023-02-17T18-08-36 082Z](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69323411/219743500-c3505247-2d01-4bce-801d-da4cc65b018a.png)

Voil√†

‚ùó 55,333,033 people added Elon's last 246 tweets to FAVORITE ‚ùó


ANSWER TO QUESTION 2 --> ‚ùìHow many views he had over these tweets ‚ùì


We will do the same as we did on the first question

We will jump directly to the answer, because it's the same solution as in the first question

![Firefox_Screenshot_2023-02-17T18-18-06 591Z](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69323411/219747570-70067fc2-3869-42d2-bf9b-d402f97e346c.png)

He had 8,290,593,970 views

BIGQUERY PART


ANSWER TO QUESTION 3 --> ‚ùìHow many times he mentioned someone in his tweets ‚ùì

For this question we will use BigQuery. We need to upload our Sheet to BigQuery, but first we need to download it from Sheets.

![Firefox_Screenshot_2023-02-17T22-15-49 314Z](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69323411/219804851-b3e95382-2be8-42e3-8032-6fb513c25d14.png)


Then we go to BigQuery and upload our CSV file with Elon Tweets Stats we worked on earlier




![Firefox_Screenshot_2023-02-17T22-13-34 822Z](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69323411/219805013-ee95b175-c7a1-4da4-ab24-b400a09df7f9.png)



![Firefox_Screenshot_2023-02-17T22-16-21 832Z](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69323411/219805030-5a1ee3b9-710e-4b4f-9120-0fa05c69dc15.png)


We choose the file, on settings it will complete some fields for you. On the region put US or EU, depending on your location. Choose the dataset, if you don't have any, hit the "create new dataset" and call it as you like.

When your file will be uploaded to BigQuery you'll be able to preview it. You'll see the same columns and the same information here.


![Firefox_Screenshot_2023-02-17T22-27-39 102Z](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69323411/219805778-1e7b26f5-3a78-4a7e-b9fe-bc0998209483.png)


For our question we'll need to run some SQL queries, so we will open a new tab in our BigQuery console

![Firefox_Screenshot_2023-02-17T22-29-00 076Z](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69323411/219806652-75be7998-8ba7-4ffc-b8ec-0b105765a993.png)

And here we will write this query and run it to see the results


![Firefox_Screenshot_2023-02-17T22-34-39 581Z](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69323411/219808904-9d381e68-b023-45c0-be1f-3b3b2f6c1d78.png)

We can see he mentioned people 8 times over 246 tweets


![giphy](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69323411/219809592-32d2dd21-97c5-457f-86ed-ee1eb7986dc5.gif)


ANSWER TO QUESTION 4 --> ‚ùìHow many tweets there are with a media file with a photo or image‚ùì

We will do the same step as in the third question, just the query will change a bit.


![Firefox_Screenshot_2023-02-18T11-20-19 583Z](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69323411/219857490-eb810bf2-5072-4f71-aaa0-918f5f4d412e.png)


My boss liked BigQuery and asks me to perform some other calculations.

He asks "What is the average and the maximum favorite count on these 246 tweets?"

And with only one query, we answered his questions


![Firefox_Screenshot_2023-02-18T11-29-25 500Z](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69323411/219857876-0af08817-5df5-4aea-a60a-bc1128320688.png)


What if we created some cool reports with these stats?
