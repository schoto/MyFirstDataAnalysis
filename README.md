# MyFirstDataAnalysis
I decided to do my first data analysis on Elon Musk's Twitter profile (likes,reposts,views,retweets, etc) I won't be using complex tools or languages. It's just a start for me, so be kind, please üôè 


All the steps I did and every achivement of this process will be displayed here in this README document

Let's begin?

First I went to Elon's Twitter account to copy the link (I need it to scrape the data from there)

Now I go to Apify which is a web scraper. You don't actually need to download any kind of software : all on website.


#######I know I could use Python for this task, but as I said earlier , I won't be using complex tools or languages######

Apify is not the only option you have if you want to do some web scraping. You may consider another option, I know this one is fast and does everything I need for this task.

Here's the Apify interface. Tasks are called ACTORS and you have a lot of pre-configured ACTORS, like Linkedin and others.

If you click on task, you can see it's parameters

You have several tabs

And of course you can export all of data you scraped. I will download the CSV format, because I'll upload it later to Google Sheets for cleaning
